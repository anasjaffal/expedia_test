# Expedia - PHP Task

>This task built in PHP language, I choose it because I am PHP developer.

I used Laravel Framework which I am not familiar with it, but my aim is to build a task on new framework and learn it.

By using this application you are able to search for the hotels for specific destination, start date, end date, minimum star rating and number of rooms you want.
